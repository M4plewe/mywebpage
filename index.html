        <p>Lasagna (UK: /ləˈzænjə/,[1] US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/; Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]), also known as lasagne (Italian:
            [laˈzaɲɲe])
            , is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian
            cuisine
            it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato
            sauce),
            béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings
            and spices.[3]
            The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled
            with the other ingredients
            and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or
            rectangular portions</p>
